### miRNA Metabolome - wide association study: A multi-omics integrative approach to Asthma

**Abstract**

**Introduction**

Both microRNAs and metabolites have been identified as significant biomarkers for many conditions. Multiple studies have shown that various metabolic stimuli alter miRNA expression, and conversely miRNAs regulate most cellular processes, impacting metabolism. We postulated that a systems integration of serum miRNAs and metabolites in a large childhood cohort could shed light on the combined synchronized role of miRNAs and metabolites in asthma and in broader metabolomic regulation.

**Methods**

We performed microRNA sequencing of 1121 serum samples from the Genetic Epidemiology of Asthma in Costa Rica Study (GACRS) and combined with targeted LC-MS metabolomic profiling. We performed a global miRNAome-metabolome-wide association (miR-metabo-WAS) analysis using a generalized linear model with adjustment for age, gender, height, and BMI. We applied WGCNA (weighted co-expression network analysis) to identify clusters (modules) of metabolites significantly correlated with miRNA modules and clinical features of asthma. 

**Results**

We identified 2800 significant association between 214 miRNAs and 228 metabolites at 5% FDR. In WGCNA analysis, seven metabolite modules were associated with clinical features of asthma at a 10% FDR (adjusted p-values 8.5 × 10-2 to 2.7 × 10-14). One of these metabolite modules showed strong significant correlation (P-value: 3.0 × 10-5 to 2.0 × 10-35) with five miRNAs modules which were also significantly associated with asthma clinical features (adjusted P-value: 8.6 × 10-2 to 4.5 × 10-3). This module comprised 20 metabolites, including diHOME’s, sebacate, and cortisol, strongly correlated with six serum miRNAs (mir-143-3p, mir-22-3p, mir-320b/c/d and mir-483-5p), all of which have previously been reported as asthma-related miRNAs. This module also contained many of the strongest individual miRNA-metabolite associations identified in the miR-metabo-WAS. miRNAs and metabolite modules were associated with airway hyper-responsiveness, airflow obstruction, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, eosinophil and IgE count, and history of asthma-related hospitalization. 

**Conclusion**

The relatively concentrated effect of miRNAs on metabolite clusters shows that while miRNAs may target and regulate hundreds or thousands of genes, their impact on the resulting metabolism is fairly constrained in asthma. This study of serum microRNA and metabolites demonstrates the value of a combined microRNA-Seq and metabolomics approach to identify meaningful clinical associations and broader truths about genomic regulation of cellular metabolism.

### From Gene Regulation to Metabolites: A Multi-Omics Framework for Investigating Airway Hyperresponsiveness in Pediatric Asthma

**Abstract**

**Introduction**

Airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) is a prominent feature of asthma, with complex molecular mechanisms involving multiple pathways. This study explores how changes in miRNAs and metabolites during childhood asthma may lead to changes in AHR.

**Methods**

In the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP), we analyzed 564 children with asthma using longitudinal AHR (PC20) measures and plasma metabolomic profiling, among whom 491 children also provided serum for miRNA sequencing at baseline. Our aim was to uncover time-dependent interactions between metabolites or miRNAs and AHR. Linear Mixed models were used to assess the interactions between metabolite/miRNA and AHR adjusting for age, sex, race, treatment group and recruitment clinic, where interaction p < 0.05 was considered significant. Joint pathway enrichment analysis of miRNA and metabolites with significant interactions was performed with MetaboAnalyst V5. 

**Results**

The mean ages at the three studied time-points across 16 years of follow-up in CAMP were 8.8, 12.8, and 17.4 years; the mean PC20 were 2.1 mg/ml, 7.7mg/ml and 11.6 mg/ml, respectively, indicating less AHR as children grew. Decreasing PC20 values was found to be associated with lower levels of lung function (prebronchodilator percent predicted FEV1, p < 0.001), asthma symptoms, and a subjective clinical staff assessment of asthma severity (p < 0.001). We found that 72 (14.4%) of the 501 identified metabolites and 72 (27%) of the 266 identified miRNAs exhibited a significant interaction with time on AHR. The joint pathway enrichment analysis of significantly interacting metabolites and miRNA target genes revealed the enrichment of several biochemical pathways that have been implicated in AHR development through impact on allergic airway inflammation, mucus hypersecretion, smooth muscle contraction, and oxidative stress. 

**Conclusion**

Our findings provide evidence to support broad changes in metabolites and miRNA regulation of genes accompanied general clinical trends of asthma improvement and decreasing AHR in children with mild to moderate severe asthma. These omic indicators were enriched in pathways associated with key molecular mechanisms involved in AHR. Longitudinal multiomic analysis is likely to be informative in additional populations and conditions.
